     <h2>Plan Ahead and Prepare</h2>
<p>Know the regulations and special concerns for the area you'll visit.<br>
Prepare for extreme weather, hazards, and emergencies.<br>
Schedule your trip to avoid times of high use.<br>
Visit in small groups. Split larger parties into groups of 4-6.<br>
Repackage food to minimize waste.<br>
Use a map and compass to eliminate the use of marking paint, rock cairns or flagging.</p>

<h2>Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces</h2>
<p>Durable surfaces include established trails and campsites, rock, gravel, dry grasses or snow.<br>
    Protect riparian areas by camping at least 70 meters from lakes and streams.<br>
    Good campsites are found, not made. Altering a site is not necessary.<br>
    <h3>In popular areas: </h3>
    <p>
        Concentrate use on existing trails and campsites.<br>
Walk single file in the middle of the trail, even when wet or muddy.<br>
Keep campsites small. Focus activity in areas where vegetation is absent.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>In pristine areas:</h3>
<p>
    Disperse use to prevent the creation of campsites and trails.<br>
Avoid places where impacts are just beginning.<br>
</p>
<h2>Dispose of Waste Properly</h2>
<p>
    Pack it in, pack it out. Inspect your campsite and rest areas for trash or spilled foods. Pack out all trash, leftover food, and litter.<br>
Deposit solid human waste in catholes dug 15 to 20 centimeters deep at least 70 meters from water, camp, and trails. Cover and disguise the cathole when finished.<br>
Pack out toilet paper and hygiene products.<br>
To wash yourself or your dishes, carry water 70 meters away from streams or lakes and use small amounts of biodegradable soap. Scatter strained dishwater.<br>
</p>
<h2>Leave What You Find</h2>
<p>
    Preserve the past: examine, but do not touch, cultural or historic structures and artifacts.<br>
Leave rocks, plants and other natural objects as you find them.<br>
Avoid introducing or transporting non-native species.<br>
Do not build structures, furniture, or dig trenches.<br>
</p>
<h2>Minimize Campfire Impacts</h2>
<p>Campfires can cause lasting impacts to the backcountry. Use a lightweight stove for cooking and enjoy a candle lantern for light.<br>
    Where fires are permitted, use established fire rings, fire pans, or mound fires.<br>
    Keep fires small. Only use sticks from the ground that can be broken by hand.<br>
    Burn all wood and coals to ash, put out campfires completely, then scatter cool ashes.</p>
<h2>Respect Wildlife</h2>
<p>Observe wildlife from a distance. Do not follow or approach them.<br>
    Never feed animals. Feeding wildlife damages their health, alters natural behaviors, and exposes them to predators and other dangers.<br>
    Protect wildlife and your food by storing rations and trash securely.<br>
    Control pets at all times, or leave them at home.<br>
    Avoid wildlife during sensitive times: mating, nesting, raising young, or winter.</p>
<h2>Be Considerate of Others</h2>
<p>Respect other visitors and protect the quality of their experience.<br>
    Be courteous. Yield to other users on the trail.<br>
    Step to the downhill side of the trail when encountering pack stock.<br>
    Take breaks and camp away from trails and other visitors.<br>
    Let nature's sounds prevail. Avoid loud voices and noises</p><br>
